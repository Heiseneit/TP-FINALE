            <p style="color:white;font-size: 25px"><mark>The first production Mirage 2000C (for Chasseur) flew for the first time on November 20, 1982 in the hands of Guy MITALS-Maurouard, and was delivered at the end of 1982-beginning of 1983. Its first unit, the 1/2 Cigognes squadron in Dijon , became operational on July 2, 1984 on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Air Force. However, the M53-P2 engine and RDI radar suffered from laborious tuning. This is why it entered service in a degraded version, equipped with an M53-5 engine, and, for the first 37 units, with RDM (Multifunction Doppler Radar) radar.

        <p style="color:white;font-size: 25px">Entered into service in 1999, the Mirage 2000-5 is a modernized 2000C. It is equipped with display instruments replacing analog instruments and a new RDY radar giving it simultaneous firing capabilities on several targets with MICA missiles, smaller and more modern than the Magic 2. It is used in mission of Sky police on the territory but also in OPEX (external operation). The Air Force has 40 Mirage 2000-5s in its fleet.

        <section class="textem2kd">
        <p style="color:white;font-size: 25px"><mark>The Mirage 2000D is a version specialized in conventional ground attack, directly based on the two-seater Mirage 2000N. It was also named Mirage 2000N 'for a while.
            The prototype, a modified Mirage 2000N, took to the air for the first time on February 19, 1991. The French Air Force ordered 86 units (nos. 601 to 686), the first of which took to the air on March 31. 1993. It entered service in April 1995 and deliveries were completed in February 2002.
            The Mirage 2000D looks a lot like the Mirage 2000N, except that the 2000N has a PITO probe at the tip of its nose unlike the 2000D. It carries the same radar (an Antelope 5), but SCALP-EG or Apache missiles as well as Mk 82, GBU-12, GBU-16, GBU-22, GBU-24A / B, GBU-49 and AASM bombs. Like all Mirage 2000 two-seater, its speed is limited to Mach 1.5 due to the immobile air inlet mice. In addition it is devoid of cannons. On the other hand, it can carry a laser designation nacelle.
            It entered service with the 1/3 Navarre squadrons (since November 1993, it replaced the Mirage IIIE), 2/3 Champagne (since July 1996, it replaced the Mirage 2000N) and 3/3 Ardennes (from June 1994, to replace the Mirage IIIE), at Nancy-Ochey, where it is still in service today. It was also in service with the 4/33 Vexin in 2002 then with the 3/11 Corsica which replaced it in Djibouti in 2008.

        <p style="color:white;font-size: 25px"><mark>The Mirage 2000N was designed at the request of the French Air Force to replace the Mirage IV in the role of nuclear deterrent, from 1978. It is based on the Mirage 2000B, but with a reinforced structure for low flight. altitude, and an Antelope 5 radar (this radar has a limited air-to-air capacity, with a range of 15 nautical miles). It carries an ASMP missile, 2 Magic 2 self-defense missiles and 2 2000-liter tanks in order to compensate for a reduced range compared to the single-seater Mirage 2000. However, just like the Mirage 2000B, it is devoid of guns, and cannot carry a laser designation pod since the ground attack is not its primary destination. On the other hand, it is refuelable in flight. It must be able to fly at 200 feet at 600 knots.
            2 prototypes were built, the first of which made the inaugural flight on February 3, 1983 in the hands of Michel Porta. 75 serial copies (n ° 301 to 375) were built, the first of which flew for the first time on March 3, 1986. They were delivered from 1988 to March 1993. They entered service in 1/4 Dauphiné at Luxeuil in March 1988, replacing the Mirage IIIE. They also equip the 2/4 "La Fayette" from July 1, 1989 and the 3/4 Limousin from August 1, 1990. The 4th fighter squadron is then placed under the command of the FAS (Strategic Air Forces). Its essential mission is "the final warning", that is to say the destruction of targets placed just behind the Iron Curtain.
            They were built in 2 batches, the Mirage 2000NK1 and NK2.
            The Mirage 2000N K1 (31 copies) were limited: they only carried the ASMP and it even seems that before the ASMP was ready, they carried a pair of AN-52 bombs. In addition, they did not have the SPIRALE decoy launcher (electro-magnetic and infrared). The Mirage 2000N K2 (44 units) were capable of conventional ground attack, and in addition to the ASMP missile and the SPIRALE decoy launcher, had an electronic Chameleon jammer and a Serval radar warning detector. These appeared in the early 1990s.
            The Mirage 2000NK1 were then brought to the NK1 standard, a standard close to the NK2. The 2/3 Champagne was equipped with Mirage 2000N K2 from March 1991, pending the arrival of the Mirage 2000D, in 1996. It was under these conditions that a Mirage 2000N was lost in action in Bosnia, on August 30, 1995. It was in 1996, with the transfer of the Mirage IV P to reconnaissance missions, that the Mirage 2000N became the sole strategic vector of the Air Force. 60 aircraft are then in staffing, the others in reserve to fill the attrition (ten crashes in 23 years). They participate in many exercises, including Red Flag. In 2011, we will see them again in OPEX, in Libya this time.
            The Mirage 2000NK3 is capable of carrying the new ASMP-A missile, as well as a GPS and a modernized self-protection system. This program was launched in June 2003. 30 units were brought up to this standard (50 were initially planned), with operational commissioning in October 2009. It remains the only one in service in 2014, within the EC 2 / 4 based in Istres. The EC 1/4 was dissolved in July 2010 and the 3/4 in September 2011. The Mirage 2000N was gradually replaced by the Rafale, and withdrawn from service in 2018.
