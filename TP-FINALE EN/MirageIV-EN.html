            <p style="color:white;font-size: 25px"><mark>1954, the decision to equip France with nuclear weapons resulted in the need to build a bomber to transport it. Two years later, after the Suez Crisis, the Official Services launched a supersonic bomber program with a range of 1,500 km that could carry a load of one ton. Faced with SNCASO's “Super-Vautour” project, Dassault presents a variant of its Mirage program, the Mirage IV. It was originally designed for an abandoned interceptor project. It is then adapted to respond to the tender for a light bomber. An order for a prototype was placed in April 1957.
                The Mirage IV-01 made its first flight on June 17, 1959, piloted by Roland Glavany. During testing, few modifications are needed and it shows that it can fly at Mach 2.1 level for more than 15 min. In September 1960, in the hands of René Bigand, he broke two world records for closed circuit speed: 1,972 km / h over 500 km and 1,822 km / h over 1,000 km / h. Officially accepted in April 1960, the prototype was used to test the various equipment that would be fitted to the production aircraft, until it was destroyed in an accident on February 13, 1963.
                By January 1957, tests had above all shown the need to carry more fuel to achieve the desired range. Thus the Mirage IVA planned for the series is equipped with a larger wing, two more powerful ATAR 9K engines and above all a refueling pole. In May 1959, three pre-production aircraft were ordered. In 1962 an order for 50 series cameras followed, then in 1965 12 additional cameras capable of carrying a CT52 photo recognition pod were added to the initial order.
                The first production aircraft made its first flight on December 7, 1963. It entered service in 1964 and at the end of the year the first bombing squadron was operational and then provided nuclear alert. It was then the first European military aircraft capable of long-duration flights at more than Mach 2. The production lasted until March 1968. At the height of its deployment 9 bombing squadrons and 1 training were equipped with Mirage IVA.
                The original mission of the Mirage IVA is to quickly climb to high altitude and rush at Mach 2 towards its target, drop its bomb there and return. In order to show that French nuclear deterrence was operational, in 1966, Operation Tamouré was organized. Two Mirage IVs are transported to Hao's base in the Pacific for the first drop of an air-powered atomic bomb. On July 19, 1966, the Mirage IVA n ° 9 dropped a bomb on Mururoa atoll. But quickly with the development of surface / air missiles, the mission is considered too dangerous and it is modified: The aircraft must then penetrate enemy territory at low altitude, under radar cover, gain altitude just above its target drop a braked AN22 bomb then dive back and return to low altitude. For this mission the devices are reinforced and receive camouflage.
                With the arrival of the ASMP cruise missiles, 19 aircraft were changed to Mirage IVP (P for Penetration) in order to be able to carry it. The first aircraft modified into a prototype, made its first flight on October 12, 1982. The modification of the production aircraft began in May 1983 and continued until 1987. It mainly consisted of the replacement of the analog cockpit instrumentation by digital instrumentation, the installation of a new navigation and bombardment system, the replacement of electronic countermeasures and radar systems, and of course the modification of the bomb bay to be able to carry the ASMP. The ASMP's armed Mirage IVP was declared operational in May 1986. With the entry into service of the Mirage 2000N from 1988, the Mirage IVPs were gradually withdrawn from bombardment missions to devote themselves exclusively to strategic reconnaissance missions. They then carried out missions in Chad, Bosnia, Yemen, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq in 2003. The operational withdrawal of the Mirage IVP took place in 2005.
