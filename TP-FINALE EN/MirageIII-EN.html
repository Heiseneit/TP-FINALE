            <p style="color:white;font-size: 25px"><mark>In 1953, the Air Force was interested in light interceptors, simple in design, powered by small reactors and booster rockets. Three planes were proposed: the SNCASO “Trident”, the SNCASE “Durandal” and the Dassault “Mirage”. The latter flew on June 26, 1955.
                Very quickly Dassault realized the limits of these small planes and studied the Mirage II, which itself quickly gave way to the Mirage III. It flew on November 17, 1956. The aircraft quickly became supersonic. It received the improvements planned for the series and reached Mach 1.8.
                It was followed by 10 pre-production Mirage III A, ordered by the French state, for the development of the production aircraft. Mach 2 was hit on October 24, 1958, beating the British on a month-long "Lightning".
                An order for 100 production Mirage III C followed. Only 95 planes were delivered to the Air Force from 1961, the other 5 being kept by Dassault to become prototypes of other versions. The Air Force then entered through the main door into the Mach 2 club and at the same time discovered the peculiarities of piloting the delta, bi-sonic flight and stratospheric flight (thanks to the booster rocket).
                The Mirage III C successively brought 10 squadrons into this new domain. The latter were not withdrawn from service until 1988 in Djibouti. Some planes were assigned to CEV or CEAM, where they had a long career.
                Very early on, Israel took an interest in the Mirage III C and ordered 72 of them. They served from 1962 to 1982. Their performance in combat would also ensure tremendous publicity for their manufacturer. Some of these planes were ceded to Argentina, to rebuild its fleet after the Falklands War. They were withdrawn in 1991.
                South Africa bought 16 Mirage III Cs and used them between 1963 and the mid-1980s. In total about 1830 Mirage III, V and 50 were built and many still fly around the world.

        <p style="color:white;font-size: 25px"><mark>The Mirage IIIE is an all-weather ground attack aircraft that is a derivative of the Mirage IIIC; its fuselage was lengthened by 30 cm to enlarge the avionics bay and allow additional fuel to be carried. Its nose houses a Cyrano II firing radar and an NRAC-4A navigation radar giving it all-weather air-to-ground capabilities (hence the E for electronics). It is equipped with two 30 mm cannons and can carry, in addition to bombs and rockets, an AN 52 tactical nuclear weapon.
            The prototype of this version made its first flight on April 5, 1961, soon followed by two other prototypes. Following the concluding tests, the French Air Force ordered 225 production units, but 40 units were taken to meet foreign orders. The Mirage IIIE entered service in France in 1964, it provided tactical nuclear watch from 1973 to 1991, before being withdrawn from service in 1995 replaced by the Mirage 2000D.
